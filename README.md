YOLOv5 Object Detection Experiments and Results

# YOLOv5 Object Detection on Film Photos
This project uses YOLOv5 to perform object detection on both public datasets and personal analog film image.

## Overview
- Model: YOLOv5s (pretrained)
- Platform: Google Colab
- Dataset: COCO val2017 + personal image
- Evaluation: mAP@0.5 = 56.6%, mAP@0.5:0.95 = 37.1%

## Detection Result Example

## What I Learned
- Applied YOLOv5 to a non-standard image type (analog film)
- Learned how to set up detection pipeline with Google Colab
- Understood basic metrics (Precision, Recall, mAP) for evaluating models
